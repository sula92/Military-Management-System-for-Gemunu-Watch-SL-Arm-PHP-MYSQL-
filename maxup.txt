First you have to change values in php.ini file as per your requirements.
post_max_size = 1024M 
upload_max_filesize = 1024M 
max_execution_time = 3600
max_input_time = 3600 
memory_limit = 1024M 
Note - Change these values carefully. These values will impact for all of your projects of that server.
Now, If all above solutions are not working, kindly check your phpmyadmin.conf file. If you are using WAMP so you can find the file in "C:\wamp64\alias".
You have to change below values.
Values already in file are - 
  php_admin_value upload_max_filesize 128M
  php_admin_value post_max_size 128M
  php_admin_value max_execution_time 360
  php_admin_value max_input_time 360
Change above code to - 
#  php_admin_value upload_max_filesize 128M
#  php_admin_value post_max_size 128M
#  php_admin_value max_execution_time 360
#  php_admin_value max_input_time 360
Now just restart your server, to work with changed values. :)
